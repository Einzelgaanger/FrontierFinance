      "description": "The Collaborative for Frontier Finance works with diverse stakeholders – including fund managers, funders, and fieldbuilders – to accelerate financing solutions that target SGBs. We aim to set a common action agenda for SGB finance; to test and scale promising financing models; and to facilitate the flow of capital to the SGB market. With a bias to action, CFF works with stakeholders to identify, co-design and launch initiatives – or specific solutions that table SGB financing challenges - that are too complex for any one stakeholder to launch on their own.",
