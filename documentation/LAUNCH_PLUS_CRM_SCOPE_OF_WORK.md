## Executive Summary

### Program Overview

The LAUNCH+ Platform is a mission-critical digital ecosystem that operationalizes the Collaborative for Frontier Finance's €16.5M LAUNCH+ Initiative - an integrated market creation program designed to accelerate Small Business Growth Funds (SBGFs) across Africa. The platform serves as the operational backbone connecting five interdependent program components: shared services administration, technical assistance delivery, capital deployment management, portfolio company impact tracking, and knowledge ecosystem development.

### Business Context: The Small Business Finance Gap

**Market Problem:**
The World Bank estimates that small and growing businesses (SGBs) create 7 out of 10 formal jobs in Africa's economy. These businesses are critical drivers of climate adaptation, gender inclusion, youth employment, and living-wage job creation. However, there is a systemic failure in meeting their capital needs:

- **Capital Access Gap:** 100+ Small Business Growth Funds across Africa seek $2.25B to finance growth-oriented SMEs, yet have only accessed ~$790M (~33% of target capital)
- **Missing Middle Crisis:** SMEs requiring €200K-€5M in financing cannot access appropriate capital from traditional banks
- **Institutional Capital Disconnect:** DFIs and impact investors avoid SBGFs due to perceived risks: challenging fund economics (small fund models seen as unsustainable), track record deficits, high transaction costs relative to deal size
- **Domestic Capital Untapped:** African pension funds hold $1.8T in AUM but invest only ~3% in alternative assets, with minimal allocation to local growth businesses
- **Operational Barriers:** SBGFs face prohibitive legal/compliance costs, lengthy licensing processes, and limited access to world-class fund administration

**Systemic Impact:**
This capital gap undermines Africa's small businesses - the primary engines of sustainable economic development, job creation, and poverty alleviation. In 2024, CFF network funds reported 37% increase in direct jobs and 47% in indirect jobs, with 55% of roles for first-time employees, 40% for women, and 75% for youth - demonstrating strong alignment with inclusive growth objectives.

### The LAUNCH+ Solution

   - Demonstrates investment thesis and capabilities to institutional LPs
   - Flexible, milestone-linked deployment based on pipeline strength

4. **Operating Overhead Support** (€4M allocation)
   - Opex funding for team building, legal costs, investor outreach
   - Provided as loans, repayable grants, or standard grants
